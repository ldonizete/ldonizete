### Hi there! 😁

My name is Lucas Donizete from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work with full-stack developer with javascript and am a student in the tenth semester of computer engineering

In my free time I like to play (and watch) basketball (🏀), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
